      <p class="mt-8">
        At MiraHikari's Vmail, we value the privacy of our users and are
        committed to protecting their personal information. This Privacy Policy
        outlines the practices we follow regarding the collection, use, storage,
        and deletion of data on our one-time email website.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold" id="Collection of Information">
        1. Collection of Information
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        We only collect and store an email name for the duration of the session.
        This information is necessary to facilitate the functioning of our
        one-time email service.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold" id="Storage of Emails">
        2. Storage of Emails
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        All emails sent and received through our one-time email service are
        temporarily stored in Cloudflare data centers. This storage is essential
        for the proper delivery and retrieval of emails during the active
        session.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold" id="Deletion of Emails">
        3. Deletion of Emails
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Once an email expires, we ensure the complete deletion of the email from
        our system. This means that all associated data, including the email
        content and any related information, will be permanently removed from
        our servers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold" id="Data Security">
        4. Data Security
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        We take appropriate measures to protect the personal information and
        emails stored on our website. However, it is important to note that no
        method of data transmission or storage is completely secure. While we
        strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect user data, we
        cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold" id="Third-Party Services">
        5. Third-Party Services
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        We may use third-party services, such as Cloudflare, to assist in the
        operation and maintenance of our website. These third-party services may
        have access to certain user data, including email names and content,
        solely for the purpose of providing their services. We ensure that any
        third-party services we use are reputable and have appropriate data
        protection measures in place.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold" id="">6. Information Sharing</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        We do not share, sell, or disclose any personal information or email
        content to third parties, except as required by law or as necessary to
        protect our rights, property, or safety.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold" id="Cookies">7. Cookies</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        We may use cookies to enhance the user experience on our website. These
        cookies may collect non-personal information and are used solely for
        website analytics and functionality purposes.
      </p>
